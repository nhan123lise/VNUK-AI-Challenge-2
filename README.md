# AI-Challenge-1
A project for AI class year of 2021 at VNUK

### About the idea:

Image Captioning model generates natural captions for input images. I simply use the dataset from Kaggle and its free GPU to train model. You can find the dataset [Flickr8k Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dibyansudiptiman/flickr-8k)

### Requirements:

```
pip install requirements.txt

```
### Model:
  **Input** of the model is the *image* and **Output** is a text correspoding to provided image
The model development has the following blocks:
  - Data processing for captions
  - Saving and loading a dictionary
  - Creating model architecture and train
